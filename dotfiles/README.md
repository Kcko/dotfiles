# Dotfiles

These dotfiles should be placed in your root directory. They configure many systems on your mac, including the [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) terminal and [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and provide command line tools and aliases for your bash terminal.

The files should be mostly self-explanatory, so see them for documentation on what is included here. Of course feel free to add or remove things to your liking.
